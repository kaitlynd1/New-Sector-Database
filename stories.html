    <h3>Jacquie Hanoman – LLF Fellow 2023–2024</h3>
    <p><strong>Before LLF:</strong> Jacquie was the Executive Director of the Ross Community Center, leading transformational neighborhood revitalization work. Burnt out and struggling with joy in her work, she was encouraged by a foundation leader to explore the fellowship.</p>

    <p><strong>Why She Joined:</strong> “What really attracted me was that the fellowship stressed wellness and leadership. It sounded very promising, and that's what I found.”</p>

    <p><strong>Impact:</strong> The fellowship gave her tools to grow, reflect, and sustain herself as a leader. “At the beginning, we were told to imagine the most whole version of ourselves. That really marked the path for me.”</p>

    <div class="quote">“It really did change my life. At the end of the day, if we are not well, we cannot do our work well.”</div>
  </div>

    <h3>Corey Depina – LLF Fellow, Zumix, Boston</h3>
    <p><strong>Before LLF:</strong> Corey had been leading music and youth empowerment work at Zumix, but hadn’t invested in his own development or well-being.</p>

    <p><strong>Transformation:</strong> “It reminded me to take care of myself. Now we do personal check-ins at work. Sometimes we skip meetings and get ice cream instead.”</p>

    <p><strong>Fellowship Experience:</strong> Corey loved the alumni retreat and workshops. “It was revolutionary to be in a space where people cared not just about work, but about each other.”</p>

    <div class="quote">“The New Sector approach is about the individual. Even when I leave my role, I’ll still be someone who invests in myself.”</div>
